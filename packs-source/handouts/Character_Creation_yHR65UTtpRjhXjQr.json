Remember, retconning to improve the game experience is not a sin.</p><p></p><h2>Trait Idea Seeds</h2><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d20]]</th><th>What Strange Traits?</th><th>Who Would Wield Them?</th><th>But At What Cost?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>beauty to bend soul or society</td><td>servant or slave of the muses</td><td>strange passions kindled</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>clockwork discipline, fervent uplift</td><td>wired rationalist legionnaire</td><td>freedom denied, disorder banished</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>cyber-ascendance, plastic evolution</td><td>pitiless machine or vome</td><td>flesh despised, biology mistaken</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>distributed, eusocial experience</td><td>many-bodied colony or polybody</td><td>loneliness a curse, solitude a terror</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>divine injustice, blind righteousness</td><td>cruel zealot of a wild deity</td><td>nuance is lost, detail is obscured</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>evolution o'er reason, root o'er brick</td><td>power-hungry tree-hugger</td><td>technology is incomprehensible</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>finwizardry, capitalist supremacy</td><td>cunning trader or wily industrialist</td><td>moloch dominates, culture is sold</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>flesh as clay, face as paint</td><td>skin-changing biomancer</td><td>stability is lost, the past forgotten</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>forbidden geometries, foolish hubris</td><td>unhinged sorcerer, mad sciencer</td><td>nature disdained, tradition scorned</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>imaginary bonds of organization</td><td>dedicated ruthless administrator</td><td>ossification nears, change is scary</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>life over death, death over life</td><td>hunter or destroyer of the dead</td><td>a pleasure is lost, a joy turns to ashes</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>lost arts, hidden mysteries</td><td>resurrected ancient traveler</td><td>mistakes abound, talk is fraught</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>machine logic, alien intuition</td><td>code-addled golem mechanic</td><td>love withers, community fractures</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>physical mastery, material design</td><td>holy wizard of the ancient machine</td><td>soul grows dim, spirit becomes hard</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>senses of doom, visions of hope</td><td>prophet of a strange new future</td><td>another wall, grass is greener</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>signs in the fast stars, truths obscure</td><td>void-bound shaman of old</td><td>food grows stale, drink tasteless</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>silent death, painful trickery</td><td>prowling thief or cultish bandit</td><td>society retreats, friendships founder</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>strength, thews, and primal vigor</td><td>warrior beast from the edge of time</td><td>books and words make less sense</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>unfolded spaces, broken mirrors</td><td>bodiless angel or daemon</td><td>senses turn aside, anxieties mount</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>feral unity, survival in the ruins</td><td>solitary wasteland strider</td><td>progress falters, dreams grow small</td></tr></tbody></table><p>→ <em>Next: equip your character.</em></p>"

From a mundane wrench to a magitechnical spell anchor, from a suit of pleather armor to a biomechanical crab-head, all are items.</p><div class=\"inventory-box\"><p>You have <strong>7 + strength</strong> inventory slots for items.</p><p>Each loose item or package occupies at least one item inventory slot. Other traits, items, and events can increase the number of item slots. Each item inventory slot is 1 stone in size.</p><p><strong>At level 1 you start with:</strong></p><ul><li>One strange item of ill-disclosed origin.</li><li>One useful kit—a sack of quantum gear that fits your background.</li><li>Some starting cash. €100 to be exact.</li></ul><p>A level 0 character starts without the strange item and with just €50 cash. A higher level character starts with more cash.</p></div><p></p><h3>HOW ITEMS WORK</h3><h4>Sizes</h4><p>Item sizes in the Vastlands use abstract units that combine weight and bulk.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Equals</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 sack (sk)</td><td>10 stones</td><td>Basic cargo unit, about as much as a human.</td></tr><tr><td>1 stone (st)</td><td>10 soaps</td><td>Significant item; a saber, spear, shield, or shovel. About 7 kilograms or 15 pounds.</td></tr><tr><td>1 soap (sp)</td><td>25 cash</td><td>Small item; a signal whistle, signet ring, spike, or bar of soap (surprisingly useful in the wastes!).</td></tr><tr><td>1 cash (€)</td><td>some change</td><td>Standard currency unit equal to a laborer's day wages. Named in a nod to ancient Chinese cash.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Unless otherwise specified, an item takes up 1 stone of inventory space. 250 cash units take up 1 stone. A PC's money is usually a mix of cards, credit, notes, and units that fit in a wallet. Treat the wallet as part of their clothing.</p><h4>Available Items and Packed Items</h4><p>Available items take up at least one inventory slot each, regardless of size, but a character can use them immediately.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: A readied dagger (5 sp) takes up a whole inventory slot (1 st).</em></p></blockquote><p>Items can be packed away to save space. Readying a packed item for use takes at least one action.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Packed in a bundle, two daggers fit in a single inventory slot.</em></p></blockquote><p>Some equipment such as backpacks, pouches, purses, ammo belts, or clothing with hidden pockets can allow characters to pack away more gear than usual, effectively increasing their inventory.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Onion's synthetic skin backpack (1 st) allows him to pack away and carry 3 stones worth of small gear. Effectively, Onion can stuff 4 stones of items into a single inventory slot. However, retrieving a specific item from his backpack takes a whole action. Onion had better not pack away his inquisition squirtgun if he plans to use it.</em></p><p></p></div><h3>DROPPING ITEMS</h3><p>A character can quickly drop one item or pack as a free action on their turn, reducing any penalties suffered from encumbrance. A quickly dropped item may break, get damaged, roll away, or otherwise suffer the consequences. The referee chooses a save target.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: A pair of shoes chucked onto a grassy slope may roll downhill, a sack of stolen glass statuettes dropped on a marble floor may produce a lot of sharp glass caltrops.</em></p></blockquote><p>A character taking an action to carefully drop an item or pack avoids any risk of damaging their precious property.</p><p></p><h3>IMPROVISING WITH ITEMS</h3><p>Items are not just bundles of game mechanics. They improve a character's performance and let them do new things. Use common sense and imagination to figure out how to take advantage of your PC's equipment.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Rafts let characters float, while climbing gear helps scale surfaces that are impossible to free-climb.</em></p></blockquote><h3>HUMAN CLOTHES</h3><p>Baseline humans have evolved to wear clothes. Any garments suitable for a tropical or temperate climate that such a character wears take up no inventory slots. You can describe them on the back of the character sheet.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: boiler suit, ship overalls, field loincloth, civilian sarong.</em></p></blockquote><p>Additional sets of clothes, or garments that provide benefits or modifiers, occupy inventory slots as usual.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: a corporate suit (1 st) provides status benefits and access to temples of finance, a classical toga (3 st) blocks one arm and marks the wearer as a member of the ruling class in some Decapolitan republics, nomad robes (1 st) serve as armor, very warm clothes (2 st) are useful in the domains of Winterwhite, an environment suit (1 st) protects against radiation ghosts, etc.</em></p></div><p>Characters who are not evolved to wear clothes, such as cat lords, spectrum satraps, some golems, and other strange creatures, do not get a free inventory slot for the garments they wear.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: a cat lord wearing a cute little jump suit (1 st) and knit cap with foopy antennae may not look annoyed, but they can't carry quite as many sacrificial mouse victims as they might wish.</em></p><p></p></div><h2>ONE STRANGE ITEM</h2><p>Exactly what this item does is a mystery. It could turn out to be an item of prophecy, linked to your character's destiny or your community's fortunes. It might also just be daemon garbage or a broken piece of forgotten history.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sdm.strange_items_table.RollTable.qxFOiAYqzqDiu4Yc]{Strange Items}</p><p><br />Selling Your Strange Item</p><p>Figuring out what it does is a hassle.

A settled character can use their kit to make a living.</p><p>You have <strong>a kit for one of your background traits</strong>. A kit is a gear item with the starting kit flag ticked, like: @UUID[Compendium.sdm.gadgets.Item.4Y6UXEQrWZFCHfmU]{Starting Kit}</p><p>The kit measures a whole sack (10 stones) in heft and includes up to 10 individual items. You don't need to choose in advance exactly what is in your character's kit—the items are in a quantum superposition until you define them as you play.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Noë has a background as a plumber (don't ask) and starts with a plumber's kit. Noë doesn't list each individual item in the kit. As she adventures, she produces useful O-rings, allen wrenches, lengths of pipe, and sealing tape from her kit. She lists these in her kit box, leaving space for 6 more quantum items.</em></p></div><p>The kit includes nothing better than a civilian weapon (1d6 damage) and no armor. You can buy more weapons and armor with your starting cash.</p><p><em>(To unpack an item from your starting kit, right-click the starting kit item on your character sheet and select the option Unpack item.)</em></p><p></p><h2>STARTING CASH</h2><p>Many kinds of cash are possible: the traditional luminous cowrie of the coastal communities (lb), the high-end plastic Casino gold piece (cgp) of the Red Land District, the traditional bunker-era duraplastic chit (dpc) of the Red and Orange Coprosperity Merchant Region, the sky-dragon scale (sds) of the Cat-affiliated knowledge societies, the prized ferroceramic puck-and-triangle of the Emerald City (fpck), and the completely ethereal noöspheric digital cash of the Dream Canopy (vdx).</p><p>For simplicity, the abstract \"€\" symbol covers them all.</p><div class=\"inventory-box\"><p>You have <strong>€50 + €50 per level</strong> in physical currency. Enough to live on for a few months, if you are careful and boring. You're not, though.</p><p>That's not much per level, honestly.</p></div><h4>What Cash Buys</h4><p>Precisely how much €1 buys varies with place and time (and referee whim), but a reasonable baseline is 100 theoretical convertible imperial universal dollars from Finite Earth A.D. 2025 to €1. Example purchases:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Price</th><th>Purchase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>€0.1</td><td>common meal or ingredient, mass tourist souvenir</td></tr><tr><td>€1</td><td>day's food and lodging for two proletarian baseline humans, basic tool, uncommon ingredient, fancy meal</td></tr><tr><td>€10</td><td>day's food and lodging for two mildly enhanced bourgeois humans, professional tool, rare ingredient, opera ticket</td></tr><tr><td>€100</td><td>day's food and lodging for two betterfolk aesthetically-augmented humans, rare or expert tool, very rare ingredients, basic vehicle, hut, small farm</td></tr><tr><td>€1k</td><td>day's food and lodging for two abmortal oligarchs, uncommon vehicle, small cottage, middling farm</td></tr><tr><td>€10k</td><td>hour's rock-hitting trip for an imperial executive unit, rare vehicle, comfortable residence, large farm or ranch</td></tr><tr><td>€100k</td><td>nearly super-heroic augment, luxurious residence, plantation</td></tr><tr><td>€1m</td><td>abmortality, seat on the neo-imperial shadow parliament, modest palace</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A character can dream, right?</p>"
