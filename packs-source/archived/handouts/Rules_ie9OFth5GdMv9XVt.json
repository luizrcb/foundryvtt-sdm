They use a cat groom to carry things for them.</em></p><p>Some traits may expand inventory slots.</p><h4>Pets and Sidekicks</h4><p>Each of a character's pets and sidekicks occupies a trait or item inventory slot. This represents the character's care and attention.</p><h4>Powers and Spells</h4><p>Each power or spell occupies a trait or item inventory slot. This represents either a technomagical anchor or the engraved psycho-physical channels that grant the character access to this unnatural power.</p><h4>Prosthetics and Augments</h4><p>Each implant or modification occupies a trait or item inventory slot.</p><h4>Additional Inventories</h4><p>Traits and containers can create new sub-inventories. For example, a high-quality singing Long Ago backpack. Draw these on the character sheet or in a notebook.</p><h3>BURDENS</h3><p>Burdens are 20 special inventory slots for afflictions, traits, and items that are so difficult to bear that they impose penalties to your actions.</p><div class=\"inventory-box\"><p><strong>Each burden imposes a -1 to all rolls.</strong></p><p>At 20 burdens, you can move or speak slowly and carefully, but can't take almost any other actions.</p></div><h4>Item and Trait Overflow</h4><p>If you run out of regular inventory slots for traits or items, you can store the excess among your burdens.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Onion is carrying his equipment (8 st) and an armoire (10 st). With a strength of 1, he has 8 item slots. The armoire takes up ten burden slots, imposing a -10 penalty on all his rolls.</em></p><p><em>Unwisely, or desperately, he tries to chase off a ligneous skeleton (L1, corken) with a blast of hot plasma from his wand-gun. He might still overcome and roll up on the skeleton's stomping grounds (on a roll that beats the target 14 defense with a bonus of +5, even after deducting the penalty, an overall chance of 0 or 5 in 20 of landing a blow, depending on the double damage).</em></p><p><em>Still, even a glancing blast from the hot plasma might frighten the ligneous skeleton. After all, cork burns so well, does it not?</em></p></div><h4>Afflictions</h4><p>Curses, diseases, mutations, corruptions, injuries, phobias, the impact of facing a true demon, and other afflictions occupy burden slots by default.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Fatigue (affliction) You are drained by your exertions or the actions of an ill-daemon. Reduces maximum life total by your level.</em></p></div><p>Such afflictions often impose additional penalties in addition to the standard -1 to all rolls.</p><p>Some spiritual and psychological afflictions may occupy trait slots instead, while diseases and physical injuries could occupy item slots at the referee's discretion.</p><h4>Removing Burdens</h4><p>Dropping cumbersome items immediately removes that burden. Releasing the magitechnical formulae of powers or spells also immediately removes that burden.</p><p>Removing other traits requires psychosurgery, shamanic intervention, or an increased thought score. Removing afflictions is harder, requiring rest and care.</p>"

Sources of experience include:</p><ol><li><strong>Novelties.</strong> When you explore, braving danger to see something new. Earn 1d6 × 10 xp per discovery or experience.</li><li><strong>Quests.</strong> When your PC makes progress on some terrible quest. Earn 1d6 × 100 xp per session's worth of progress.</li><li><strong>At the referee's pleasure.</strong> When you do something extraordinary, act in character, help the other players, and generally make the session memorable and fun. 1d6 × 10 per prosocial deed.</li><li><strong>Session attendance.</strong> At the end of a session, earn 500 xp for showing up and being a good egg.</li></ol><p>The referee can set other sources of experience, such as:</p><ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Scavengers.</strong> Earn 1 xp per €1 of treasure recovered from an ancient ruin.</li><li><strong>Pícaros.</strong> Earn 1d6 × 100 xp after spending that much cash carousing for a week and risking strange setbacks.</li></ol><p></p><h2>INVESTING EXPERIENCE</h2><p>All experience earned is banked until you invest it to level up a character(s), their pets and sidekicks, or their hallmarks. You can invest experience in other players' characters, pets, sidekicks, and hallmarks, if they agree.</p><p>Each pet, sidekick, or other hallmark with invested xp occupies a trait or item slot on their owner PC's sheet.</p><h3>Investing in PCs</h3><p>Your player character is also your main or primary character.

Heroism rubs off on things.</p><p>A PC can own a number of hallmarks equal to their level.</p><p>All hallmarks start at level 0 unless specified otherwise.</p><p>Leveling them up costs experience, as with any other character, but also has material costs if it does not flow from in-game events (at the referee's discretion).</p><p>Each level, a hallmark gains an upgrade such as:</p><ol><li>a +1 bonus to every damage die (so 2d4 becomes 2d4+2) at a cost of €5 per item level, or</li><li>a +1 defense bonus (so a shield's bonus goes from +1 to +2) at a cost of €10 per item level, or</li><li>another new trait, power or complication such as the upgrades listed in the equipment section (p78).</li></ol><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Safir smashes the backup mind-soul jewel of the deathless general of the City of Mirrors with his accelerated hammer.

Some may be acquired with careful study, others from strange ancient powers. In both cases, becoming skilled (or an expert or master) requires more in-game work.</p><ol><li>Write down the new trait in a suitable inventory slot.</li><li>Figure out how many people and/or other sources you must study and absorb to acquire the skill (usually three to become skilled).</li><li>Each mentor, library, knowledge stone, or what-have-you is at a different location. Some sources may be found as treasures in the course of adventuring.</li><li>When you find a source, absorb its essence over one week of focused study (or meditation or bonding or mind surgery), then roll thought to beat a target of 11 (a moderate thought roll). If you fail, you can try again after a further week of study. If you fail a second time, this teacher is not suitable for you.</li><li>After tallying three successes, your PC is skilled in the new trait.</li></ol><p>Progress from skilled to expert requires 4–6 successes, and from expert to master 5–9 successes. Some traits may require more successfully absorbed sources.</p><p>The referee peppers sites and mentor NPCs around the map, creating a personalized quest.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Onion has observed the porcelain princes' masterful crafting of masks and faces, and wishes to become a facemaker, so he could create new faces for himself and pass as other people with ease.</em></p><p><em>The referee agrees this could be a worthy trait. The first place to start learning about masks as faces would obviously be the Porcelain Citadel. This is enough of a hook for the player to write down the facemaker trait, with space for three tallies.</em></p><p><em>The referee consults their Grand Map. It will take Onion at least 3 weeks of travel to reach the Porcelain Citadel and look for a mentor. The search could take another week and Onion's studies will take at least one more week. With travel events and the other PCs' shenanigans, that affords plenty of play time to seed clues for future study locations Onion can research and visit.</em></p></div><h3>Increasing Ability Scores</h3><p>Traits, items, mutations, oldtech upgrades, and fantascience boons may permanently increase characters' ability scores. Such artifacts make great treasures to motivate character quests.</p><h3>Adversity and Decay</h3><p>Characters do not only become stronger. Age, injury, and magitechnical mishaps may bestow burdens and traits that wear them down. Curses, monsters, defeats and psychemagical travails may permanently reduce their ability scores.</p><p>The referee should be clear with players before their PCs take a course of action that may result in permanent injury. Permanent changes should be the result of risks freely taken by the player.</p><div class=\"example-box\"><p><em>Example: Noë dreams of becoming a terrible and powerful wizard to prove to her mother that she is not a failure.</em></p><p><em>The referee provides rumors of an electrical brain holding albums of great power, and Noë excitedly pursues them. However, the more she learns of the brain named Ata'ari, the clearer it becomes that the price of ultimate mastery is the destruction of her physical human body.</em></p><p><em>Will she go this far? Or will she take some of her knowledge and sell the rest to fuel new escapades?</em></p><p><em>A referee may then provide quests to stave off a character's inevitable decline and demise.</em></p></div><p>Alternatively, a player may decide to retire their character and promote a sidekick or create a new character. One option is to give the new character fewer xp than the lowest-level player character or the highest-level available sidekick (whichever is less) at the table.</p>"

You leave behind the last of the feral chitin plantations. The grasses peter out and regolith replaces the rich soil of the humaniformed lands.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>\"You begin to worry that you might need to eat your clone mules, but then you spot a forcebubble dome enclosing a verdant oasis. As you come closer it appears ... a pleasure garden, a haven of peace.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion and Safir, eager to rest, do not question this good fortune, but Noë is more suspicious.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë says, \"Wait. Before we enter, do we see any defense automata, angels of the Long Ago or other dangerous systems?\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat replies, \"You take some time, eating into your supplies, to scout the perimeter. You find some crude, cobbled-together biomechanical sensors and bypass them. You can approach unseen.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>The party agrees to proceed cautiously.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat continues, \"Nobody blocks your entrance and soon you are in an oasis of calm. You spot human-like figures playing games, eating fruits, and dozing.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Now even Onion is suspicious, \"Lazing leisure people here? This far beyond the Garden? I send my card clone to greet them.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat nods and responds, \"Your cardboard copy walks to the nearest human. It looks up; first surprised, then overjoyed. 'A visitor!' it cries and runs towards the copy, 'come, come fellow hewman! Take joy with us!'\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion grumbles, \"Ok, the card clone follows, carefully.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat replies, \"These hewmans seem quite naïve, they offer glittering sweet fluids and perfumed fruits.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Safir mutters, \"We've found lotus eaters. I just hope Cat doesn't intend we harvest them for supplies.\"</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The muchanics keep the mechine alive.<br />The mechine makes the hewmans live.<br />The hewmans keep the muchanics fed.<br />— <em>Litany of the Undying City,</em> Gilded Semi Barbarian, Fruit of the Three Tree (3782)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>38</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>THE ROLL</h4><p>When a PC tries something risky, the referee describes the challenge and stakes, then <strong>offers a target number</strong>. The target number represents the odds of success.</p><h4>Typical Target Numbers</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Target</th><th>Odds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>3</strong></td><td>trivial, casual, banal (excellent odds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>7</strong></td><td>easy, simple, routine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>11</strong></td><td>mediocre, moderate, average, medium, [null], Ø</td></tr><tr><td><strong>15</strong></td><td>hard, challenging, tasking</td></tr><tr><td><strong>19</strong></td><td>very hard, confounding, arduous (terrible odds)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If a player has a good plan or makes a reasonable argument that sacrificing additional resources or equipment would help, the referee can offer additional bonuses or even an automatic success.</p><p>The PC then has to <strong>roll over the target number</strong>:</p><p><strong>d20</strong> + <strong>ability</strong> (if applicable) + <strong>skill</strong> (if applicable)</p><h4>Roll, Narrate, or Skip?</h4><p>The odds and the stakes (whether the fruits of success or the price of failure) of a scene help the referee decide when a roll is called for.</p><p>The referee should skip through scenes where nothing is at stake, unless the players are enjoying themselves.</p><p>When the stakes are low, the referee can simply narrate outcomes, using player input and worldbuilding when it makes sense.</p><p>Similarly, when the odds are impossible or certain, the referee can usually just narrate outcomes.</p><p>However, as stakes get higher, even low odds of disaster or exceptional success build tension and call for rolls.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë runs from the slow-moving ba-zombies, jumps into the autogolem, and makes to roar away. Cat interrupts her and asks for a trivial roll, lest she fumbles the keys. Noë, the nimble wizard, smirks and rolls... a natural 1. The keys fall to the bottom of the autogolem and the ba-zombies draw closer. Cat offers a dilemma, \"Make sure all the doors are locked, but get surrounded; or a moderate agility roll to grab the keys and rev the engine before one of the decayed ex-humans gets in at the passenger side.\" Noë picks up the fateful die.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>39</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>ROLLING NUANCES</h4><p>The dialogue and the roll cover 9-in-10 situations. The following mechanics cover most remaining edge cases.</p><p><strong>Magic Numbers</strong> — some natural rolls on the d20 are special:</p><ul><li><strong>1 — Fail; equipment notched.</strong> Put a small mark next to the item. If it suffers more damage, it breaks.</li><li><strong>13 — Only one ammo or other resource left.</strong> Put a small mark next to the item. After the next use, it is spent.</li><li><strong>20 — Always succeeds.</strong> Apply double effect or an additional stunt (trip, trick, trap), then roll again. Yes, the d20 always explodes (see below).</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>Example: Safir runs in pursuit of the bolted pack mule. Cat rules this a hard test of endurance. Safir is confident this will work out. The fighter rolls 13. With an endurance of 4 and a survival skill adding 3 more, that's a 20—more than enough to easily catch the mule. However, the 13... Cat suggests the chase has depleted Safir's archaic golem armor, leaving enough juice for just one more fight. Safir blanches, but has nothing else that might have been depleted in the chase and agrees.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Lucky 7 Option:</em> the referee provides a benefit or bonus when a natural 7 is rolled—even if the roll is otherwise a failure. This puts pressure to improvise on the referee.</p><h4>Exploding Dice</h4><p>Exploding dice are marked with an asterisk (dX*). When you roll the exploding die's <strong>highest face</strong>, roll again and add the results together. Keep rolling as long as the die keeps showing its highest face. D20s always explode, even without an asterisk.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion goes to a merchant to sell the liquid metal shapeshifting executioner's blade his quick fingers 'inherited' from the sad space knight. Cat rules this is a random merchant, who is willing to pay €1d6* × 10 for the square blade. Onion rolls a 6. The die explodes and Onion rolls again. A 5. The merchant offers €110 for the blade. The cunning Onion grins and spends a hero die, bumping the second roll to 6 and exploding it again. How long can the die keep exploding? Depends on Onion's luck and hero dice...</em></p></blockquote><p>Rolling multiple dice creates complex probability distributions. They can be fun to play with for the referee and a useful part of their toolbox, but can quickly become opaque to the players and slow at the table.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë is communing with a smart lock, encouraging it to accept her as a scion of the ship's captain with rights to enter the inner power vesicles. Cat's random encounter table offers up four shipfolk hunters. Cat decides they are sneaking up on Noë. Cat rules that Noë has to roll a save to see if she is surprised. She applies a -1d6 penalty to the roll because she is not sure quite how preoccupied Noë was, nor how quiet the shipfolk. Noë must roll d20 -1d6 over 13. If she fails, the shipfolk catch her unawares.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Hard Limit Option:</em> modifiers to a d20 <strong>cannot exceed +/-13</strong>. If they would exceed 13, the referee may rule an automatic success (or failure), or limit the modifier to +/-13 and also assign [+a] or [-d].</p><h3></h3><h4>Bonus and Penalty</h4><p>The referee assigns a bonus [+] or penalty [-] to d20 rolls when circumstances favor or hinder a PC. The size of the modifier is up to the referee and more art than science.</p><p>Traits, items, events, burdens, and more also give bonuses or penalties. The referee has final say when and how different modifiers combine.</p><h4>Typical modifiers</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Modifier</th><th>Effect</th><th>%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>+/-1</strong></td><td>A tiny modifier, barely noticeable in play.</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>+/-6</strong></td><td>A significant modifier, very noticeable even in a short scene.</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>+1d6 / -1d6</strong></td><td>A pretty random modifier, useful in muddled situations.</td><td>17.5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>[+a] / [-d]</strong></td><td>Roll 2 dice and take the better or worse result. Also called advantage and disadvantage. Increases the probability of extreme natural rolls, while leaving the highest and lowest possible roll unchanged.</td><td>16.6%</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>40</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Roll on Target - Force a Situation</h4><p>When you roll precisely on target, PCs can <strong>sacrifice something to succeed</strong>. In a pinch, roll a d8:</p><ol><li><strong>Resources:</strong> spend more ammo, charges or fuel.</li><li><strong>Damage:</strong> equipment or vehicles get marked.</li><li><strong>Life:</strong> the exertion saps the PC's plot armor.</li><li><strong>Burden:</strong> the exertion strains or injures the PC.</li><li><strong>Alert:</strong> opponents become aware of your efforts.</li><li><strong>Benefit:</strong> foes get a bonus on their turn.</li><li><strong>Innocents:</strong> allies or bystanders are injured.</li><li><strong>Risk:</strong> the situation becomes more dangerous down the line.</li></ol><p>The referee has final say on the choice of sacrifice.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion whips out his electric pistol wand and fires off a volley at the onrushing rabbit clansman. He rolls a 10, adds his agility (4) and skill with wands (3) for a total of 17. Precisely the same as the clansman's physical defense score. Cat suggests Onion can hit the swift clansman if he discharges the whole omnibattery. Onion agrees and rolls for damage...</em></p></blockquote><p><em>More Sacrifices:</em> the canny referee will notice that the sacrifice mechanic lets them offer hard choices to PCs whenever they fail, or even pre-emptively...</p><h4>Group Roll</h4><p>When the whole group is trying to accomplish something risky, <strong>a random PC rolls for the whole group</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: The party decides to quietly sneak through the Craquelure Queen's crypt to reach the ge-yao golem and access its sleeping mind. The security golems look dead, but one can never tell with this vile oldtech. Cat judges this a hard roll. She rolls a die to decide which PC should roll and it falls on Safir, the fighter. Safir looks uncomfortable in its archaic golem armor. That powered contraption is shouting for a hefty penalty. A classic disadvantage: two dice and pick the worse result. Safir rolls 20 and... 2. Even after adding its skill (3) and agility (3), the bluelander fighter's roll is a sadly lacking 8. The party blunders. Cat asks what happened and Safir mumbles about a vase. Cat nods and elaborates how the party mistook a stack of celadon pots for a plinth and knocked it over, awakening a guardian spider (L6, petrifying) woven of golden threads and iron wires...</em></p></blockquote><h4>Suitable and Unsuitable Equipment</h4><p>Under pressure, the referee can impose a penalty on characters without suitable equipment for tasks they are otherwise skilled at. Conversely, having precisely the right equipment can provide a bonus. The referee makes the final decision.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion sidles up to a smart door and prepares to hack it. With a start, he realizes it is a White City-brand security door—the same as his 'borrowed' security rootkit. Cat agrees to let him roll 2 dice and take the better result, since he has the perfect tools for this hacking job.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Time + Equipment = Automatic Success</h4><p>A character with suitable equipment and few time constraints succeeds at ordinary tasks without rolling.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: The party comes upon a roiling stream. Nearby, an old rowboat is tied to a tree stump. Noë wants to use it to row across. Cat decides the swift stream is not exactly easy to cross, but if the PCs take their time they should have no trouble. She suggests to Noë that she can row across without rolling if she spends two turns. Noë ponders. More time passing gives Cat more opportunities to roll for random encounters and depleting resources, but a bad roll risks tumbling into the water... she decides to cross carefully.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>41</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Roll When It Counts</h4><p>With long-duration activities, <strong>only roll when it counts</strong>.</p><p>These are things like hiding, moving stealthily, gossipping politely, participating in society dance, standing guard over a prisoner all night, etc.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion sets an ambush for the moss-covered elf spawn. He covers himself in cool mud and bark to hide from the elf spawn's infrared vision and prepares a swinging spiked log trap to take out the deadly hunter. Then he waits.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat does not ask for a hide roll from Onion yet. Instead, she waits to see if and when the elf spawn enters the vicinity.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"First hour. No spawn,\" says Cat, rolling encounters. \"Second hour. No spawn. Third hour. No spawn. You feel the mud drying, your concealment must be weakening. Do you take the risk of breaking cover and reapplying it, or stay hidden? If you stay hidden, the roll is harder, but there's no chance of the elf spawn catching you unawares.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion stays still and hidden.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"Fourth hour. The spawn pads into view, silent as a smilodon. Roll to see how well you've hidden yourself. Its infrared eyes glow yellow in the night. It's a pretty hard roll now. 17, not 15 like before.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion's player whispers a ritual prayer over the d20 and rolls. With +7 from agility and skill, this calls for every bit of dice magic...</em> <br /><br /><em>11. Plus seven, it's 18. The concealment worked.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion releases the spiked log and yells. The moss-covered elf spawn looks at Onion, double jaws working hungrily. It does not see the spiked log swinging swiftly from behind.</em> <br /><br /><em>The surprised spawn takes a log into the back and Onion rolls 1d20 for damage.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Dice Oracles</h4><p>When a player, including a referee, does not know what might happen in a situation and there is little risk, rolling dice on a table gives a working answer.</p><h4>Quick d6 Oracle</h4><table><thead><tr><th>d6</th><th>Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1–3</strong></td><td>common or expected outcome (50% odds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4–5</strong></td><td>uncommon or unusual outcome (33% odds)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6</strong></td><td>rare or exceptional outcome (17% odds)</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><em>Example: The caravan pulls up at a gas house near Three Sticks Lake. Noë's player wonders what the weather is like.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat, the referee, rolls a d6 to consult the dice oracle. The result is a 5: uncommon. She ponders a moment. It's autumn and the area has a continental climate, so the usual weather is cool. She decides it is a gloriously warm indian summer.</em></p></blockquote><p>The referee can set up oracle die tables to suit the odds they want. 2d6 offers a bell curve, 1d10 offers more options, and so on.</p><h4>Skilled d20 Oracle</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Roll</th><th>Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>≤3</strong></td><td>nay and woe!</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4–7</strong></td><td>nay</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8–13</strong></td><td>perhaps, for a price</td></tr><tr><td><strong>14–19</strong></td><td>yea</td></tr><tr><td><strong>20≤</strong></td><td>yea and more!</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This oracle is useful when a PC's traits and abilities come into play.</p><p>Roll d20 + modifier.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion wonders if there is a group of rubes in Umber who'd be willing to play Sunder Mister Shield or Spin the Golem's Head. Cat asks Onion to roll with charisma or thought, to see what he sniffs out.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion rolls a 7. His charisma is 5. A total of 12. Cat reads the skilled dice oracle and tells Onion that perhaps he could find some gamblers, but there would be a price. A week's supplies as a buy-in.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion casually offers Noë's supplies as the price of his gambling 'investigation'.</em></p></blockquote>"

        "content": "<h4>ABILITIES AND TRAITS</h4><p>The PCs can try to do anything that makes sense in their situation. They are not limited to the abilities, traits and items listed on their character sheets. A PC's character sheet represents the resources they bring with them to the situation. Their environment almost always offers additional resources.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: After crawling through a purification-era storm sewer, our heroes find themselves in a hole with a skylight far above. The path forward looks blocked, the ground covered in windblown dirt.</em> <br /><br /><em>Reviewing their equipment, they find they have rope, pitons, and a geologist's hammer. This could help them climb out.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë carefully searches the walls of the hole for any clues. Cat notes this takes about ten minutes and asks the other players if they want to do anything as well. Onion scours the dirt for anything valuable, while Safir resigns itself to hammering in pitons and broadening handholds to climb out.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat rolls for random encounters (since time passed and the hammering was noisy), but no atomic remnants come to check on our heroes. Cat then asks Noë and Onion for skilled oracle rolls using their thought abilities to see if they find anything useful. She has quietly decided that a roll of 14–19 turns up some marginally useful debris, while 20+ reveals actual useful equipment secreted here long ago.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion rolls 7+3, a 10. Nothing in the dirt. Cat offers that further digging has even odds of finding useful debris, but calls for another encounter roll. Onion passes.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë rolls 16+5. A 21. Cat describes how Noë's careful probing of the walls finds a cabinet obscured by rust and dripstone. A few strikes with the hammer opens it, revealing a handwheel labelled \"ladder\" in White City pictographs. Safir's strength and the magnificent build quality of the purification era turn the handwheel, and the corroded remnants of hand- and footholds emerge from the wall. Not an excellent ladder, but it makes the ascent easier.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>43</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>APPROACHES</h4><p>How do PCs get things done?</p><ol><li>The referee presents a challenge.</li><li>The PCs choose their approach.</li><li>The referee gives clear feedback on the costs and odds of a chosen course of action.</li><li>The PCs confirm or revise their approach.</li></ol><p>PC actions tend to fall into one of five types:</p><ul><li><strong>impossible</strong> under current circumstances</li><li>dependent on <strong>pure luck</strong></li><li>determined by <strong>natural ability</strong></li><li>a product of <strong>skill and ability</strong></li><li>a <strong>sure thing</strong></li></ul><p>The referee has different options in each situation.</p><h4>Impossible</h4><p>If a roll is impossible without a certain skill (or even with a skill), the referee may <strong>disallow any roll</strong>. Characters are not utter fools and the referee should advise the players that they need a different idea, possibly even suggesting an unimaginative and costly alternative.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë thinks her ability to speak with crabs might let her sway an eight-legged vomis abomination. Just because it has eight legs doesn't mean it was ever a crab; indeed, this abomination used to be four people. Cat makes this clear and suggests running away instead.</em></p></blockquote><p>Players can't read the referee's mind, nor vice versa. The ref shouldn't trap players with secret gotchas.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion argues that he could convince a catlord to give him its cute fluffy pants. Since these are an integral part of the catlord's aura of cuteness and winter resistance, the referee decides it is impossible to convince the catlord to give up the fluffy polkadot wonderpants. The ref further implies that badgering the catlord for its pants may cause it to 'misuse' its tele-empathetic prowess.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion accepts that words will not succeed and begins to plot how to steal the wonderpants while the little catlord takes its milk bath.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Pure Chance</h4><p>The course of action leaves no room for skill, natural ability, or divine favor. The character <strong>rolls a bare d20</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion spends night on a casino's one-armed bandit. There is no skill or fortunate spirit here.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Natural Ability Alone</h4><p>When skill isn't a factor, or a character lacks any suitable skill. The character <strong>rolls d20 + ability</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Safir wants to stoically endure a biomechanical upgrade, but it lacks the biofeedback skills of a cogflower accountant monk required for such pain resistance. Still, Safir adds endurance to the roll: d20+4.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Skill and Ability</h4><p>Players aim for this situation, since it gives the best odds. The character <strong>rolls d20 + ability + skill</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion is trying to maneuver a bulk regeneration pod holding Noë's plasma-burned bod into a storm shelter. He benefits from his strength (+1 as well as his background (+3) as a debt collector where he had to efficiently dispossess criminal debtor of their furniture to pay back their kindly loan-shar creditors. Safir looks on, unimpressed.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Sure Thing</h4><p>The outcome is certain and rolling is a waste of time. The referee suggests an outcome; if the player accepts, there is <strong>no roll required</strong> and play moves on. If the player wants an even better outcome, the referee proposes a risk and lets the player decide to roll or not.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë wants to impress a dirt farmer with he neon wizardry. Cat rules that the farmer has neve seen electricity before and it's a sure thing.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë asks if she could use her display of power convinc the farmer to part with their mule. Cat snorts and say that's very hard, and if Noë fails, the farmer runs bac to the village shouting about a dangerous witch.</em> <br /><br /><em>Visions of torches and pitchforks in mind, Noë stick to a positively impressed dirt farmer who offers loca information, but keeps their beloved mule. The mule' name is Pringles (L1, dapper) and it loves turnips.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>44</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>RELEVANT ABILITIES</h4><p>Common sense usually dictates which abilities apply and which don't. Strength helps with lifting heavy objects, agility with dodging rotten tomatoes, endurance with long marches.</p><h4>Multiple Abilities Apply</h4><p>Sometimes multiple abilities apply. PCs can choose which ability to use.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Safir looks at a rough slope. It's a climb but not particularly hard. Cat agrees that bot strength and agility could apply, so Safir opts for it higher strength. Using its synthetic musculature, th bluelander hauls itself up with brutal efficiency.</em></p></blockquote><p>The referee may apply penalties or bonuses to a particular ability.</p><h4>Specific Abilities</h4><p>Some situations prescribe specific abilities.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: in combat, melee attacks use strength ranged attacks use agility, oldtech uses thought, and fantascience uses charisma.</em></p></blockquote><p>Traits may also describe the specific abilities they use.</p><h4>Alternate Abilities</h4><p>Traits or items may allow alternate abilities in specific situations.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: An intuitive sword lets a character use aura to make melee attacks. A sentient oldtech mortar lets a character use charisma to make long-range attacks. A mind-interfaced autogolem lets a character driv with charisma instead of agility.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Missing Skill</h4><p>When a character lacks a required trait for a task, the referee assigns a penalty as they see fit.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Safir is trying to land a gyrocopter whil under fire from savages in souped-up autogolems. Cat rules that Safir's background as a caravaneer i a trait that warrants some general familiarity wit vehicle controls, but hardly enough to give a bonus t complicated maneuvers with a flyer. Cat disallows any skill bonus and asks Safir to roll two dice and take the worse result. A harsh penalty, but fair.</em> <br /><br /><em>Safir rolls a 2 and a 17. The gyrocopter crashes into sour water distiller. Oops.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>45</em>]</p></blockquote>"

        "content": "<h4>TO FIGHT OR NOT</h4><p>When words have had their day, the struggle begins. This may be a fight with plasma machetes and ghostbreaker guns, but it can also be more abstract.</p><p>Conflicts are risky for the PCs, so their procedure is more defined than most other game mechanics.</p><ol><li>The referee <strong>outlines dangers</strong> before a conflict breaks out.</li><li>Conflicts are not inevitable. Often, <strong>reaction rolls</strong> determine NPC reactions.</li><li>Conflicts <strong>unfold in rounds</strong>. Each round, the <strong>sides roll initiative</strong>, then act in turn.</li><li>After a few rounds, one side usually tries to <strong>flee</strong>, <strong>retreat</strong> or <strong>surrender</strong> — either because of a failed morale roll (the opponents) or the players' decision (the party).</li><li>The winning side may get one final shot.</li><li>The conflict ends. The winners survey the spoils of victory. The losers gnaw the bitter bones of defeat.</li></ol><p>If the PCs are not involved in a conflict, the referee can simply consult the dice oracle and narrate the results.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Our heroes are walking carefully through th growth at the edge of the Limbback Wood. Cat rolls a encounter between a posse of vampire knights and group of feral false humans—falschers. She calls for stealth roll, and Onion draws the rolling straw. Luck for the party, the sneaky Onion rolls 17 + 4 (agility) + (skilled). 24. Neither side has seen our heroes.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat narrates how the vampire knights open up on th falschers with their electric lances, felling a handfu of the soulless automatons and sending the other running about in panic.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë, Onion, and Safir see how the wind is blowing. They stay hidden.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat shrugs and rolls the oracle dice to see wha happens. She expects the knights to prevail, but there' always a chance. The d6 flies through the air and...</em></p></blockquote><h4>BEFORE THE CONFLICT</h4><p>In the vast majority of situations, the referee ensures the players know when their characters face a potential conflict. The referee also clarifies the possible stakes: death, dishonor, robbery, capture, etc.</p><h4>Dangerous Environment</h4><p>The referee communicates when the characters have entered a high-threat environment, whether this is a dungeon, a war zone, or an abandoned warp factory.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Cat narrates, \"After a week's relativel uneventful travel through the Burnt Umber, you hav come to the Chitin Woods, where the feral biomantic experiments of the Planter Lords still hold sway. You hackles rise and you can almost feel the alien, pain ridden eyes on you from the shadows of the strang forest of organisms that seem to have been bred fro a nightmare, half crustacean and half fungus or tree. Foes and dangerous creatures could spring from th undergrowth at any time. How do you proceed?\"</em></p></blockquote><h4>Dangerous NPCs</h4><p>Likewise, the referee communicates when the characters encounter a creature or person who could be a threat if they become hostile.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Cat narrates, \"The bulky enforcers of th Piebald Paw swagger into the bathhouse. Their chiti armor is grown to fit and their blasters are polishe and maintained. A fight with them could be deadly. Other patrons quietly make themselves scarce. If thes armored grooms find out that you had anything to d with the Wicked Turnip job, you could be in trouble.\"</em></p></blockquote><h4>It Came Out Of Nowhere</h4><p>It is best when the PCs choose to face danger because they feel the potential rewards outweigh the risks. Then, in those circumstances, surprise, ambushes, and sudden attacks may come into play.</p><p>The referee should be wary of springing conflicts out of nowhere, without reason or foreshadowing. They have the entire Given World at their fingertips, they do not need this kind of unsportsmanlike trickery.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>46</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>REACTION</h4><p>Sometimes, it is unclear how a group of NPCs should react to the player characters. This is often the case with random encounters while traveling. In such cases, the referee's best friend is the reaction roll. Think of it as an oracle of behavior. To see how the NPCs behave, a <strong>random PC rolls 2d6 + cha.</strong></p><h4>NPC Reaction (2d6 + cha)</h4><table><thead><tr><th>2d6 + cha</th><th>Reaction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>≤1</strong></td><td>They come at you, like raving agents of cosmic corruption.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2</strong></td><td>Aggressive, hostile. They attack, given half an excuse.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3–5</strong></td><td>Thanks, they hate you.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6–8</strong></td><td>Unsure, waffling, complicated, suspicious.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9–11</strong></td><td>Polite, understanding, sympathetic.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>12</strong></td><td>Friendly, interested. They'll help, given half a chance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>13≤</strong></td><td>They insist on helping, even if you don't need help. Rude to say no, but they will waste your... Oh, dear. Cup of tea?</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If the PC wants to provoke a conflict, they may subtract their charisma from the reaction roll instead. Nice, manipulative people get into fewer unchosen fights.</p><p>Some traits may modify reaction rolls. The referee may apply penalties or bonuses depending on the PCs' appearance and behavior.</p><h4>Flee &amp; Freeze &amp; Fawn</h4><p>Most NPCs are not mindless abominations out for bile and blood. People and creatures who feel threatened by the PCs may flee instead of attacking. Creatures that feel particularly overpowered may cower in terror, beg for mercy, or offer to serve their new tyrants, the PCs.</p><h4>ROUNDS</h4><p>When a conflict breaks out, play proceeds in rounds.</p><ol><li>Each round the sides roll initiative.</li><li>Then, the side that won initiative acts.</li><li>Next, the side that lost initiative acts.</li><li>If one side suffered badly this round, the referee may decide they need to roll morale.</li><li>Then, the round ends.</li></ol><p>The <strong>length of a round is cinematic</strong>, not precise. It's long enough to do something meaningful. In a duel, a round might last mere seconds; with submarines chasing each other, it might last hours.</p><h4>Initiative</h4><p>Every round, a random character from <strong>each side rolls:</strong></p><p><strong>2d6 + agility</strong></p><p>High roll goes first. Traits, circumstances, burdens, and the referee may apply other modifiers. The players decide their characters' turn order when their side acts.</p><p><strong>When initiative rolls are tied, chaos reigns</strong> and everything happens at once. The PCs and their opponents take their turns, but damage and afflictions only take effect at the end of the round. This is how two duelling swellswords stab one another right dead and proper.</p><h4>Turn</h4><p>Each round, each character gets a turn when their side acts. On their turn they <strong>do something</strong>.</p><p>Characters need to be aware of where they are and what locations or creatures they can reach or target.</p><p>Traits, items, and circumstances can give additional or special turn actions.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>47</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>ACTIONS</h4><p>On their turn, a character can do nearly anything the player comes up with. The referee adjudicates whether it requires any die rolls and whether bonuses or penalties are called for.</p><p>Most turns, a character does some reasonable combination of <strong>movement</strong> through space and <strong>interaction</strong> with the environment and other characters.</p><p>This may mean walking over to an enemy and giving them a solid what for. Or any of a number of other things:</p><blockquote><p><em>Examples: climbing a ladder, disarming a bomb, picking a lock, resuscitating a fallen comrade, planting a secre message, inflating a balloon, filling a gas tank, scrawling a warning. And, yes, diving from a doorway to the cover of bulky sofa while firing a volley from two fully automatic ancient pulii pacificatores.</em></p></blockquote><p>The actions described in the following paragraphs are ideas for things characters could do in a conflict and how to adjudicate some situations.</p><h4>Movement Actions</h4><p>You're mostly moving around, maybe doing something else not too involved, like unholstering a carbine, reloading a carbine, or wondering whether you left your stove on when you left your house this morning to explore the sewers.</p><ol><li><strong>Disengage.</strong> Carefully, guarding against counterattacks, you back away from close combat. You move nearby, just out of reach.</li><li><strong>Flee.</strong> Carelessly, you turn your back on your melee opponent and head far away. Your foe gets a free attack. Probably with a bonus. Foes with guns may also get free attacks. Beware.</li><li><strong>Move.</strong> You move nearby. Right there. No sweat, just a nice easy walk. You could combine this with readying a weapon to catch foes doing funny stuff.</li><li><strong>Sprint.</strong> You move somewhere farther away, over there. Just as fast as you can. Look out, you might trip on some obstacles, and if there are enemies about, they may get a free attack.</li><li><strong>Charge.</strong> You rush a nearby creature, getting a bonus to your attack. Attacks against you also get a bonus until your next turn.</li><li><strong>Swing on Chandelier.</strong> Or other swashbuckling affair. Lovely use of the environment. Roll agility. Success: a bonus with your next action (probably an attack combined with the swing). Failure: your foe gets a reaction attack with a bonus, or you're put into a humorously compromised position.</li><li><strong>Climb a Ladder.</strong> Depending on ladder length, that's probably all you'll reasonably do this turn.</li><li><strong>Drive.</strong> Or direct a ridestrich. Steering, not crashing.</li></ol><h4>Attack Actions</h4><p>Attacks are actions taken to directly damage your foes.</p><p>Melee, ranged, oldtech, and fantascience are the four most common types of attacks, but others types are also possible. Traits and gear can unlock attacks with special effects, bonuses against specific targets, in certain environments, or from a character's abilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Attack.</strong> An adjacent foe with a melee weapon, or a more distant enemy with a suitable ranged weapon.</li><li><strong>Skirmish.</strong> You hop from behind cover, fire off a round, and hop back. The mobility isn't great, but cover protects.</li><li><strong>Careless Attack.</strong> Attack with no regard for your safety. Get a bonus on your attack, but if your enemy survives they get a free counterattack.</li><li><strong>Ready Attack.</strong> Prepare to counterattack if a foe comes in range. If that happens, your attack resolves before your enemy's. If it doesn't come in range, your attack is wasted. The referee can use oracle dice to decide what enemies do, to keep things fair.</li><li><strong>Suppressing Fire.</strong> Lay down arrows, bullets, or maser blasts, imposing a penalty on your foes' rolls.</li><li><strong>Furious Attacks.</strong> Roar as you unload your magazine into the monstrous rabbit of Blaargh. Spend your turn hacking away like a human possessed. No moving, no tactics, and your foes get a bonus against you on their turn, but you attack twice.</li></ol><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>48</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Tactical and Support Actions</h4><ol><li><strong>Take Cover.</strong> You dive behind suitable terrain. Ranged attacks against you suffer a penalty.</li><li><strong>Hide.</strong> Make yourself discreet, so you can't be targeted. Requires suitable cover or camouflage gear and a successful agility or thought roll.</li><li><strong>Sneak Away.</strong> If enemies can't see you, you can move to a different location and surprise them, or flee without getting attacked.</li><li><strong>Reload.</strong> Some complicated or big weapons need a full action to reload.</li><li><strong>Grab On.</strong> Grab hold of a target. Probably requires a strength or agility roll. It can't move away without dragging you along.</li><li><strong>Hang On.</strong> A kaiju lumbering away? Roll endurance or agility to hang on.</li><li><strong>Hold Down.</strong> Smaller? Make a strength roll to pin down a grabbed target. A pinned creature can't move or attack anyone except you.</li><li><strong>Help Hold.</strong> Rush in to help an ally hold down a pinned target. It suffers a penalty to breaking loose.</li><li><strong>Shake Off.</strong> Attack an enemy that has grabbed or pinned you.</li><li><strong>Defend.</strong> Turtle down and don't attack this round. Attacks against you suffer a penalty.</li><li><strong>Protect.</strong> Bat away blows against a target. Attacks against it are rolled with a penalty.</li><li><strong>Drag Away an Ally.</strong> Get your friend to safety. If they are conscious, they might struggle, forcing a strength roll.</li></ol><h4>Other Actions</h4><ol><li><strong>Use Power.</strong> Sometimes known as casting a spell.</li><li><strong>Control Power.</strong> Not all powers are fire-and-forget affairs. Some, such as <em>Waxni's Magic Cruise Missile</em>, require active control.</li><li><strong>Chug Potion.</strong> You drink a potion. Or apply an ointment. Or slap on a healing parasite.</li><li><strong>Communication.</strong> Command a golem, convey a complicated plan, or check instructions in the nöospheric post you have received.</li><li><strong>Swap Tools.</strong> Carefully stow the gear you're using and ready something else. You can rush it: toss your current gear to the ground, pull out a hidden pistol, and use it with a penalty.</li><li><strong>Pick a Peck of Pickled Peppers.</strong> Or a pocket.</li><li><strong>Activate Magic Door.</strong> Or unlock a regular one that doesn't say whoosh.</li></ol><h4>Free Actions</h4><p>Some actions, such as dropping a carried sack or responding to an opponent's folly (such as their critical failure), are free actions.</p><p>A character can take <strong>at least one free action per round</strong>.</p><p>Typical free actions in an ordinary conflict:</p><ol><li><strong>Amble.</strong> Nonchalantly.</li><li><strong>Chew.</strong> Gum.</li><li><strong>Concentrate.</strong> On one thing.</li><li><strong>Drop.</strong> A held object.</li><li><strong>Drop.</strong> To the ground.</li><li><strong>Jab.</strong> The exposed flank of an oblivious falscher shoving past you with your elbow (or a shiv).</li><li><strong>Spit.</strong> Out a curse (or a grunt of pain).</li><li><strong>Release.</strong> Your <em>ka-ba</em> mental form from the prison of your flesh (die).</li></ol><p>The referee uses common sense and the conflict time frame to put a stop to nonsense like stacking a dozen free actions to time lock an enemy and explode it from the inside out with some obscurely argued edge case.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion has a trait that lets him hide as a free action. He is also carrying a round bomb in one han and a pistol in the other.</em> <br /><br /><em>He wants to take a shot at the lead froglin, then drop a bomb as a free action so it rolls towards a group o froglins, then dive behind a pillar and hide as a free action.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat rolls her eyes and points out that's really a bi much. The way Onion is trying to drop the bomb i more of an attack than a \"drop.\" He can either shoot or roll the bomb, but not both. Alternatively, he can stay where he is, shoot and roll the bomb, but not div behind the pillar. Does Onion feel lucky enough to face a bomb blast?</em> <br /><br /><em>Of course he does. He's a PC.</em></p></blockquote><p>Traits and items may provide additional free actions.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>49</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>IMPROVISING ACTIONS</h4><p>Not only can the players come up with new actions, they are encouraged to. Most player ideas fall into one of four categories, making improvisation easier for the referee.</p><h4>Great Idea</h4><p>PCs get a bonus on their attempt. The referee can offer more options (with extra danger) to tempt them.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Safir has figured out the Grand Golem's wea spot: the red control crystal in its head. Cat rules tha reaching it takes a hard climb and the golem gets free stomping attack first.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"We can pilot Onion's magic pocket hang glide through its empty eye socket,\" says Safir, deadpan.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"That's a great idea. Roll with advantage to reac the head, but if the golem swats you, you'll take extr damage hitting the ground.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>\"Maybe we can distract the golem in some way,\" wonders Onion.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"You could sing and dance in front of it,\" suggests Ca dubiously.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"Brilliant! I'll airhorn it, so it won't try to swat Safir!\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat wonders if Onion is aware that the Grand Golem will try to splat him instead... and could well succeed.</em> <br /><br /><em>Surely he is?</em></p></blockquote><p>Some possible temptations the referee can offer:</p><ol><li>Capture a prize. If the PCs expose themselves to an attack, they might snatch a foe's weapon, steal a vehicle, or score a coup.</li><li>Double or nothing. They've done it, but for just a little more risk, they might double their success.</li><li>Gain acclaim. If the PCs succeed with a more difficult approach, they wow onlookers and cow opponents.</li><li>Negotiate from strength. By risking more and showing strength, they can gain a pause—a chance to parlay. Everyone gets to live!</li><li>Turn the tables. Having survived an onslaught or escaped a fight, they might seize a tactical counter at the cost of valuable resources.</li><li>Win the scene. For an added risk, the players can end the fight, get the prize, or otherwise short circuit the scene.</li></ol><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>50</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Interesting Idea</h4><p>The PCs get an extra effect or flavor if they succeed. To spice things up, their opponents may get a free counter if the attempt fails (or a bonus on their turn).</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion thinks it'll work just fine to put on spectrum satrap's fine enviro-suit and run their voic through the modulator. That'll put the fear of the</em> <br /><br /><em>Un-God into the local merchants!</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat ponders, then says, \"We-e-ell, ok. If you succeed sure, they'll be floored with the majesty of you presence. But if they see through you, they'll haul yo up in front of the magister for fraud.\"</em></p></blockquote><p>Possible additional costs of failure:</p><ol><li>PCs lose initiative and go last next turn.</li><li>The PCs or their equipment suffers wear and tear.</li><li>The opponents have a chance to steal the PCs gear or snatch their weapons.</li><li>The quarry has a chance to get away scot free.</li><li>Onlookers will find the PCs laughable or weak.</li><li>The tide turns, time is wasted, and the enemy will get reinforcements of some sort in 1d3 rounds.</li></ol><h4>Risky Idea</h4><p>The referee can offer an extra effect if the PC succeeds. After that, the PCs' opponents get a free counter or a bonus on their turn.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë is going to slip into the kingpin' dreams and incept an idea to make the kingpin see Noë as their long-lost daughter.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat looks dubious, suspecting this plot i lifted whole-sale from an over-complicated entertainment video.</em> <br /><br /><em>Still, she agrees... but warns Noë that th kingpin's dream may twist Noë's mind with it hopes and desires immediately after. Good luck with that aura save.</em></p></blockquote><p>Possible costs of risky maneuvers:</p><ol><li>Equipment used has only one charge remaining.</li><li>Surviving opponents all safely disengage and flee.</li><li>The PC needs to rest for a round or suffer fatigue.</li><li>Enemies learn about a weakness and have a permanent bonus against the PCs from then on.</li><li>Witnesses become hostile and unfriendly.</li><li>The PCs can't move from their zone next round— perhaps a narrow, crumbling bridge with a coalfire demon in front and clackling cobblins behind.</li></ol><h4>Terrible Idea</h4><p>The PC can attempt their plan, but there will be a cost. At the very least their opponents get a free action to stop them, possibly with a bonus if the idea is truly stupid.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: \"And then I'll surf the floating force-fiel disc into the vomes, terrifying them with my display o magical prowess!\" chortles Onion.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat looks blankly at Onion.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"I'll give them all a save to see through your fals divine pretenses and a free attack if they are unconvinced.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>\"Would my charisma apply?\" asks Onion.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"Fine, I'll add your charisma to their save target. Remember, there's eight of them.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>\"It'll be fine!\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Dear readers, it was not fine.</em></p></blockquote><p>Possible prices for terrible ideas:</p><ol><li>The agents of Law have a 50% chance of tackling the PC before they can shout their condemnation.</li><li>The hench-shadows of Chaos have a 1-in-4 chance of possessing the PC when they open the soul-box.</li><li>A spherical boulder rolls down a ramp towards the careless idol thieves. Save or squash, yeah?</li><li>The referee gives the PC's speech a 1-in-6 chance of convincing the Radiant Worm not to eat them.</li><li>The sheriff's men shoot the PC, then the PC shoots, then roll to see how much damage the PC took.</li><li>The ill-nano battlewagon goes over the cliff ... and so does the PC's royal racer. Roll next session to see if the PC can be raised as a charcoal revenant.</li></ol><p>Obviously, the referee should not trick the PCs into thinking terrible ideas are good ideas. Springing save-or-die effects and similar disasters on PCs without proper build-up or clues is poor form.</p><p>Sometimes allowing a terrible idea can make for a truly memorable scene—especially if the PC fairly survives against damnably dreadful odds.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>51</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>MOVEMENT AND RANGE</h4><p>The referee uses narrative zones to describe the scene and how characters and objects relate to one another. They note distances and ranges as they go, sketching a scene and clarifying as required by the players.</p><p>Exactly how a character moves, where they can go, what they can reach, depends on the conflict—where it is happening, how it is being fought. Fighting on a moving train is different from squaring off in the Electronic Crypt of Saint Baastet or a running skirmish on horseback with cyber centaurs in the Ivory Plains. The goal is to have a shared understanding of a scene, not to keep perfectly accurate time-space records.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Zone</th><th>Range</th><th>On Foot (human scale)</th><th>In Autogolem (personal vehicle scale)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>here</strong></td><td><strong>close</strong></td><td>Adjacent. Melee combat. The thick of things. A small area, a few meters across. This side of the table, in arm's reach. You may make a free attack against an adjacent enemy that disengages carelessly.</td><td>Side-by-side. Ramming range. Close enough to jump across, to throw a hand grenade. A small area, maybe 10m across. You may make a free attack against an adjacent vehicle trying to perform a delicate maneuver.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>there</strong></td><td><strong>short</strong></td><td>Nearby. The other side of the table, out of reach. A middling area, maybe 10m across. You can close for melee combat with a nearby opponent. Or, you can retreat further away, keeping them at range while firing.</td><td>Nearby. Same block, off-ramp or tunnel. Small arms range. A middling area, say 50m across. Move in to ram a nearby opponent, or retreat to safety, keeping them in range of mounted guns.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>over there</strong></td><td><strong>medium</strong></td><td>Far. Indoors, through a doorway or at the far end of a hall. A large area, maybe a few dozen meters across. Usually, you need 2 rounds to close with an opponent this far away. The first round to reduce the range to short range, the second to charge in for close combat.</td><td>Far. A stretch as long as a mile, a whole bridge, a stretch of streets, a series of switchbacks. Close enough to keep in sight but out of range of all personal arms and many vehicle weapons. A large area, as much as 100–200m across. Takes 2 rounds to reach an opponent. Possibly longer, if they're trying to evade you.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>off-stage</strong></td><td><strong>long</strong></td><td>Distant. Very far. Indoors, a few rooms away, downstairs, or behind a closed door. Not visible. A massive area, possibly 100m across. At this range you need 3+ rounds to close with an opponent. Reaching them is more a chase than a conflict (see p57).</td><td>Very far. The dust of racing hovergolems on the horizon, the roar of heart-of-coal engines in a doomed canyon. Details are obscured. Enormous area, maybe a mile across. Reaching an opponent takes 3+ rounds. If trying to evade, it's a chase not a conflict (see p57).</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><em>Example: Cat narrates, \"The abandoned void ship lock swings open and a great vaulted chamber greets you.

Far off, where you can barely see... is that movement?\"</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>52</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Relative Zones</h4><p>When a PC takes their turn, the referee summarizes their situation to help the players stay oriented.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Cat narrates, \"Ok, so Noë and Safir went up to the little quarterling with the jade axe to see if they could convince it to trade it away for some paste jewelry and a bottle of vodka. The quarterling was enraged by the suggestion and shrieked some sort of war cry, and a few quarterlings over there in the hedgerow replied. They seem to have some kind of tripod-mounted magic staff.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>\"You're right here, next to the quarterling with the axe. Let's call 'im Bob. The other two are a ways off, two turns let's say. I'll call 'em Gunbob and Ammobob.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë says, \"Your naming is really top notch, Cat.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion's player asks, \"I wasn't next to Bob the Quarterling, I was taking care of Donkey Jack nearby. Could I reach Gunbob and Ammobob in a single turn?\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat ponders and answers, \"Ye-es, but you'd be charging the gun over open ground and I'd give them a free attack against you. There is a funny-shaped rock you could run to for cover, but then you'd need two rounds. Still, if you got initiative next round, too, you could make it without giving them an open shot at you.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion nods, \"Ok, that sounds good.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat adds, \"Still, it'll take you close to the confused, humming vome in the cabbage patch... that could be risky.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion grumbles, \"Are you trying to say I should just hunker down and do nothing?\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat, \"No, no... not at all!\"</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>53</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Indoor Zones</h4><p>Indoors and in other confined areas, the movement and range zones may become smaller and more contingent, depending on doors, obstacles, stairs, ladders, passages, traps, and the like.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Cat narrates, \"Right, you enter a large hall... well, largish. Maybe eight, ten yardmeters wide and thrice as long. The four cyclopean columns in the center make it feel smaller. Arachnoid carvings cover every inch of its organic surface. Your eyes alight on an uncomfortable scene at the far end: some kind of scuttly crawling shadow human bowing and scraping before what looks like a car-size vegetable bulb with six thick cephalopod arms. The bulb is on a raised dais, like some kind of divinity too far for you to reach quickly. You also see a hint of a doorway just off to the right of the sanctuary and of course the heavy doors that swung shut behind you as you entered.\"</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë mutters, \"Of course they swung shut as we entered...\"</em></p></blockquote><h4>Vehicular Action Zones</h4><p>Outdoor scenes with fast-moving characters benefit from procedural zones, rather than precise maps.

        "content": "<h3>DAMAGE, DEFEAT, DEATH</h3><p>As attacks land, as powers drain, a character suffers damage. Once a character has suffered enough damage, they risk defeat (and death). A character's attributes are resources. Life is used to activate powers. Ability scores improve rolls. Hero dice boost results. Sacrifices turn near misses into successes. However, attributes are also a buffer protecting from defeat and death. The more spent to succeed, the greater the risk of sudden failure.</p><h4>DAMAGE</h4><p>All damage, unless specified otherwise, reduces a target's life. Some powerful items or powers may reduce abilities or levels, deplete defenses, or impose other burdens and conditions.</p><h4>Damage is Abstract</h4><p>Reducing life doesn't (necessarily) mean sprays of arterial blood. The precise effect depends on the narrative stakes. A creature could be gossipped to death, metaphorically. Once harangues and threats reduce it to 0 life, it might retreat, step aside, or be too brow-beaten to resist a killing blow.</p><h4>Damage in Deadly Combat</h4><p>Sometimes, such as while dungeoncrawling or fighting in a battle, the stakes are life and death. The referee makes these stakes clear when the party enters such an environment, or when a conflict escalates.</p><p>In such deadly combat, <strong>if an effect would reduce a character below 0 life</strong>, they are reduced to 0 life and must <strong>roll on the defeat table</strong>.</p><p>Most <strong>NPCs are out of the fight at 0 life</strong>. This doesn't mean they are necessarily dead, but unless healed or somehow repaired, they are no longer active participants. Most sentient NPCs try to flee before this happens.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: While crawling through a crypt of the Starfall Big Houses, the PCs come face to face with iron skeletons. The decayed remnants of synthetic golems, the metal endoskeletons attack without thought or mercy. The stakes are survival or death for the party.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Ability Score Damage</h4><p>Some obnoxious attacks, traps, curses, or situations reduce ability scores: strength, endurance, agility, charisma, aura, or thought. These are serious shocks, which carry the risk of death.</p><p><strong>If an effect would reduce a character's ability below 0</strong>, it is reduced to 0 and they must <strong>roll on the defeat table</strong>.</p><p>NPCs without defined abilities who suffer ability score damage reduce their level <strong>and</strong> attack bonus instead. <strong>If either their level or attack bonus is reduced to 0, they are out of the fight.</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Onion lashes the bog shambler (L4, atrocious post-human) with the holy pain whip he stole from the Avatar of Bonds. Each lash costs Onion 1 life, but deals 1d4 physical ability score damage if it hits.</em> <br /><br /><em>His first blow deals 3 points of damage, dropping the bog shambler 3 levels (L4 → L1, yowling post-human). His second blow deals 2 points of damage. This would drop the bog shambler to level -1, but that's not possible (not least because L-1 would look weird). The bog shambler is out of the fight.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat narrates how, yelping like a scalded cat, it splashes back into the lagoon.</em> <br /><br /><em>Onion asks if he can get a final shot off at the aquatic ape-human with his plasma pistol. Cat sees no reason why not, and the bloodthirsty Onion rolls to see if he can bag a trophy for his lodge-boat.</em></p></blockquote><p>The referee can apply other penalties and weakening effects to NPCs suffering ability score damage.</p><p>The referee may rule that NPCs are immune to some kinds of ability score damage. For example, brainless undead skeletons could ignore thought and charisma attacks, or damage from fear and psychic effects.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>58</em>]</p></blockquote><h4>Burdens From Damage</h4><p>Other obnoxious attacks, powers, curses, and circumstances can impose specific burdens on characters. These occupy inventory slots, reducing a character's options, imposing situational penalties, and imposing additional penalties to rolls as they accumulate in a character's burden inventory.</p><p>Each burden and affliction in the inventory applies a -1 penalty to all rolls, including defeat table rolls.</p><p>Most effects that impose burdens allow a save. The worst do not. Some burdens may specify additional effects: disease progresses over time, steps to cure the burden, etc. In all cases, the referee can adjust how burdens play out to better reflect the progress of the game.</p><p>When a character suffers a burden, but they have no available slots for burdens, they collapse; catatonic until at least one burden is removed.</p><blockquote><p><em>Example: Noë the wizard moves to open the treasured chest. She caresses its gleaming shipmetal, presses the machined buttons, and bates her breath as the lid hisses...</em> <br /><br /><em>...and falls back choking as the terrible green gas burns her throat.</em> <br /><br /><em>Cat the referee calls for a save. Noë rolls a 7 on the d20. Not enough—she needed at least a 13 to avoid injury.</em> <br /><br /><em>\"It's the pulmonary blood rot,\" whispers Cat.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë's player writes that down in her burden inventory. She suffers a -1 penalty to all rolls until she gets that fixed. Cat rules that if Noë waits long enough, she might need a fresh pair of lungs, too.</em> <br /><br /><em>Noë spits blood into a silk handkerchief, grits her teeth, and looks into the shipmetal box, hoping for something to make it all worth it.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Typical Burden: Wear and Tear</h4><p>After significant exertion—an athletic competition, a grueling journey, an interminable battle, or another wearisome challenge—the referee may require the characters, their mounts, or vehicles to roll attrition saves.</p><p>If they fail, they lose 1 endurance or aura.</p><p>If they cannot lose endurance or aura, they suffer wear and tear instead.

Connects most naturally to the static abilities of aura and endurance.</p><p><strong>Ka</strong>: Soul, fire, drive, energy, thrust, movement. Connects to the active abilities of charisma and strength.</p><p><strong>Ba</strong>: Psyche, personality, change, path, choice. Connects to the dynamic abilities of agility and thought.</p><h4>Concept Background</h4><p>Ha-ka-ba is adapted from Ancient Egyptian conceptions of the person, as in the <em>Coffin Texts</em> and <em>Book of the Dead</em>. It also echoes many religious and philosophical ideas on the transmigration of souls.</p><h4>In-Game Metaphysics</h4><p>The soul provides the motive fire of consciousness, the psyche provides the unique direction of consciousness, and the body provides the vehicle.</p><p>This trinity affects how the dead, the undead, and the resurrected behave.</p><p>A creature killed by physical means becomes a classic corpse. A creature whose soul is destroyed leaves a perfect shell, easily turned into a flesh-golem servitor (sometimes called a zombie but actually a soulless automaton). A creature whose personality is annihilated presents the most unusual situation: their soul-body dyad remains physically alive, but completely malleable; entities of human intelligence without volition, loyal to their creator. Other permutations abound.</p><p>Indeed, death is not the end.</p><blockquote><p>[@Vastlands_Guidebook, <em>p.</em> <em>61</em>]</p></blockquote>"
