The living creatures of the area eat your body and your mind and personality travel unseen in the movement of birds and beetles, the sigh of grass and the creak of trees. When the spell ends, your body reconstitutes from dead organic matter over about a day. Over the day spent in the ecosphere you gain a deep awareness of the local area and heal one burden or affliction as though you had a weeklong rest. You regain no life during your time in the circle of life. This power is dangerous for creatures other than yourself and costs double if cast on an unwilling target.</p>",
