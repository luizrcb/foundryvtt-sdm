    "description": "<p>You eat part of a creature you are familiar with to temporarily manifest one of its natural traits. A nail clipping or some fur will suffice. Each manifested trait occupies an inventory slot somewhere in your body as a 1 stone mass, but it doesn’t otherwise interfere with you and is painlessly reabsorbed when you deactivate the power. Traits may include: 1. Features like the mane of a lion, the pebbly skin of a snake or the cute ears of a bunny. 2. Senses like the smell of a shark or the hearing of an elf. 3. Aptitudes like the brachiation of an ape, the flight of an albatross or the leap of a kangaroo. Note: if you consume a pound of living flesh ([[/r 1d6]] damage), the cost of using the power is halved. However, consuming living flesh is kind of a horrible thing to do and would mark you out as a ghoul. Eating a symbolic representation, like cookies baked in the shape of a skunk to get its … aroma … instead doubles the power cost. But is much nicer.</p>",
