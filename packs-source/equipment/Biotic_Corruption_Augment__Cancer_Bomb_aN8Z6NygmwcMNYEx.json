Success: it suffers [[/r 4d6]] damage as its body voids benign alien tumors. Failure: it suffers [[/r 2d6x]] damage as four hooked limbs of muscle and keratin erupt from its skin. Each limb (L4, 8 life) attacks the nearest creature or the target for [[/r 1d6]] damage per hit. After a few minutes, the infestation loses coherence and the limbs collapse into sticky goo. Extract: ripping the infestation out is tough and deals another [[/r 2d6x]] damage to the target. The creature (L4) continues to attack mindlessly.</p>",
