    "description": "<p>You adopt the physical form of a roughly human-sized creature (say dogsized to horse-sized) you are familiar with and whose symbolic representation you own. This could be a tiger tattoo or a dodo doll. The transformation takes several minutes. Your physical abilities and traits transform to match the target. You lose access to traits that do not work in the new form. For example, a hog cannot speak, so neither can you if you shift into a hog. You stay in your adopted form as long as you imbue it with your vital essence. Warning: occupying a strange skin can be dangerous, shifting your mind (after days) or even trapping your form (after weeks). Note: if you are carrying the prepared skin of your chosen form, the power cost is halved and the transformation takes mere seconds.</p>",
