    "description": "<p>Your skin splits and you collapse into a colony organism, such as a hive of bees, a nest of naked mole rats, or a swarm of spiders. You must be familiar with the species and own a suitable symbolic representation. The transformation takes several minutes. You gain the physical abilities and traits of the colony organism and lose access to traits that do not work in this form. So long as 10% of the colony survives, you can return to your normal form without harm. If less of the colony survives, you may lose traits and memories. You stay in your adopted form as long as you imbue it with your vital essence. Warning: occupying a strange skin can be dangerous, shifting your mind (after days) or even trapping your form (after weeks). Note: if you are carrying a preserved colony or hive, halve the power cost and transform in mere seconds.</p>",
