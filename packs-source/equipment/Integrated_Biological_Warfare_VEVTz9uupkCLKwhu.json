    "description": "<p>You craft a custom symbiote that integrates into the target’s digestive tract. The crafting takes a day, the painless embedding another 8 hours. The symbiote occupies one inventory slot. On command, the host can vomit forth part of the organism as a weapon, either directly at an enemy or onto terrain as a trap. Symbiote options include: 1. Caustic Slime Worm. Short range. [[/r 2d6]] acid damage in a small radius. Save for half. 2. Writhing Thornstar. Short range. Entangling thorns in a small radius. Anyone passing through quickly suffers [[/r 1d6x]] damage. 3. Necrotic Fungaloid. Short range. Spore sac deals [[/r 1d8]] damage on impact or when triggered on. Target must save or suffer [[/r 1d6]] endurance damage as its lungs are attacked. 4. Snapping Moraykin. Close. Additional bite attack deals [[/r 1d6x]] damage. Automatically strikes enemies who are not expecting the host’s mouth to fold open and release a biting second mouth. 5. Green Grappler. Close. Tentacles grapple a target and make it very hard to pull away. 6. Sonic Hive. Short range. Hundreds of stinging insects pour forward, confusing, harassing, annoying. 7. Stunfish. Short range. A pulsating aerial jellyfish that wafts with the air currents. If struck, it detonates in a spectacular shockwave of light and electromagnetic radiation. Creatures near the jellyfish must save or are blinded and stunned for a few rounds. 8. Glue Cucumber. Short range. Spray of gooey yellow proteins glues the target to the surface. Hard save to break free. After attacking, the symbiote must regrow before it can be used again. This happens naturally in 1 week or more quickly, in an hour or so, if the host spends 1d4 life.</p>",
