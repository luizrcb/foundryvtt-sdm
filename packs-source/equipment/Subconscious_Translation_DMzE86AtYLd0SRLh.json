Any creature that takes 1 damage is stunned with immaculate joy for 1 round. Any creature reduced to 0 life by this damage falls asleep and awakens later unharmed. You cannot end skinwyrd normally. Each round in the skinwyrd, you lose 1 life. When you reach 0 life, you fall unconscious and revert to your normal form. When you awake, you regain 1d6 life.</p>",
