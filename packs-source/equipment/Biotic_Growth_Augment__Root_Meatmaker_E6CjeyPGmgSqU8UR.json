If the save fails, the growth deals [[/r 2d4x]] damage over one hour. Cutting away the affected area deals [[/r 1d6]] damage, the cutaway continues to grow. Note: the growth does not produce high quality tissue. Grown meat is spongy and tough, expanded ivory is brittle and gnarled, extended hair is flakey and hard. It’s just … bigger.</p>",
