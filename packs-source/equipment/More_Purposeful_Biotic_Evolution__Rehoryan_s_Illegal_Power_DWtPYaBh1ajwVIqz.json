    "description": "<p>This off-label power is not included in normal Rehoryan albums. This power can only be used on a creature that has already heard Rehoryan’s Prophetic Song, also known as Song 1. After eating a sample of the [missing], you may chant obsidian rituals into its vitals, encouraging a perfect evolution. This is very dangerous for the target. After 1 day of gentle sleep it permanently gains either: Far Evolved Trait: 1. gravistatic organ (can levitate in place) 2. televisual abilities (can see through another creature’s eyes) 3. photovitalic skin (meets 50% of nutritional needs) 4. improved bioluminescence (display 700 ads on your skin!) 5. incredible heat/cold tolerance 6. radiation immunity or other similar evolved trait Improved Eugenic: +3 to one ability (even above the normal maximum). Note: Using this power on the same creature twice is very dangerous and has a 90% chance of turning it into a carnivorous polymorph or mimic.</p>",
