L. SDM 3RD PARTY LICENSE 2.0

I’m astonished by the people’s stories of their adventures
in the Ultraviolet Grasslands and delighted by the
adventures and creatures, stories and locations they’ve
created. I promised a third party license a fair while
ago, but the life of a solo game creator had its way with
me. I played with making my own license for a while,
but let’s be real: I’m one, you are many, and there are
good licenses about. This one is based on the Mörk Borg
license (https://morkborg.com/license/). Check out Mörk
Borg if you prefer blackened death metal grim darkness
to the polychrome psychedelia of the synthetic dream
machine.

Let’s get to it...

i. Purpose
This license lets you write games and build on the
Synthetic Dream Machine, without waiting on my review
or approval, and without me taking a cut.

As long as you follow a few basic rules.

ii. Content
ii.a. If you adhere to these terms you can publish
free or commercial roleplaying game books
and supplements based on and/or declaring
compatibility with Synthetic Dream Machine
(SDM) without express permission from either
Luka Rejec or WTF Studio.

ii.b. You cannot reuse or translate art and text from my
works without explicit permission. You may quote
passages if you cite the source in-text (e.g. Luka
Rejec Ultraviolet Grasslands 2E 2022, 204). You can
use the names of creatures, locations, objects,
powers and other entities in the game world if you
acknowledge the source somewhere in your work.
The precise citation style doesn’t matter as long
as the source is clear.

ii.c. You can freely reuse and reference the rules
and mechanics of Synthetic Dream Machine (SDM).

iii. Branding
iii.a. You can’t use the SDM, WTF Studio, Exalted
Funeral, UVG, VLG, or other logos from my works
without explicit permission.

iii.b. You are allowed and encouraged (but not
required) to use the SDM compatible logo or an
SDM compatible logo of your own design.

iii.c.
You’re not allowed to give the impression that
you are making an official SDM product or that
I endorse or sponsor you in any way unless I’ve
made special arrangements with you.

iv. Legal
iv.a. Luka Rejec, WTF Studio, Exalted Funeral, or
any other publishers of my works take no
responsibility for any legal claims against your
product.

iv.b. Any legal disputes, controversies or claims related
to this license shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with U.S. copyright laws.

iv.c. You must include the following legal text in visible
location in your product and on any website or
storefront where you promote your product:
[Product name] is an independent production
by [Author or Publisher] and is not affiliated with
Luka Rejec or WTF Studio. It is published under
the Synthetic Dream Machine Third Party License.

iv.d. You must include the following copyright text in a
visible location somewhere in your product and
websites or storefronts:

Synthetic Dream Machine (SDM), Ultraviolet
Grasslands (UVG), Our Golden Age (OGA), and the
Vastlands Guidebook (VLG) are copyright Luka
Rejec.

v. Conclusion
Make it weird, wonderful, and wild. Don’t bring modern
hatreds and contemporary conflicts into your content.
The world of Our Golden Age is at the end of time and
space. It faces other issues. Like the dark forest and the
heat death of the gods.
